Explanation:

    server.js: Sets up the Express server, middleware, and connects to MongoDB.
    config/db.js: Configures the connection to MongoDB.
    models/User.js: Defines the User model with fields for email, password, and password reset token.
    controllers/authController.js: Contains logic for requesting a password reset (generates and emails a reset token) and resetting the password (validates the token and updates the password).
    routes/authRoutes.js: Defines the API routes for password reset functionality.
    .env: Stores environment-specific variables like database URI and email credentials.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns and keeps your codebase organized.



For the password reset flow outlined above, you will need to install several external libraries to handle various functionalities. Hereâ€™s a list of the essential libraries and packages you need to install for the backend part of your Node.js application:
1. Express - Web framework for Node.js.

bash

npm install express

2. Mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool.

bash

npm install mongoose

3. Body-Parser - Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.

bash

npm install body-parser

4. Cors - Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

bash

npm install cors

5. Bcryptjs - Library for hashing passwords.

bash

npm install bcryptjs

6. Crypto - Built-in Node.js module for cryptographic functionality.

No installation is needed as it's included with Node.js.
7. Nodemailer - Library for sending emails.

bash

npm install nodemailer

8. Dotenv - Library to load environment variables from a .env file.

bash

npm install dotenv

Installation Command

To install all the above libraries, you can use the following command:

bash

npm install express mongoose body-parser cors bcryptjs nodemailer dotenv

Summary of Libraries:

    express: Simplifies route handling and middleware integration.
    mongoose: Provides a schema-based solution to model your application data.
    body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware.
    cors: Allows your backend to handle requests from different origins.
    bcryptjs: Handles password hashing to secure user passwords.
    nodemailer: Facilitates sending emails, used here for sending password reset links.
    dotenv: Manages environment variables, such as API keys and database URIs.

Ensure you also create a .env file in your project root directory to store your environment variables, and make sure this file is included in your .gitignore to keep sensitive information out of version control.
